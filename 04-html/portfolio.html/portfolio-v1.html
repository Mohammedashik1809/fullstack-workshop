      <p>
        I am <strong>Mohammed Ashik B</strong> , an Electronics and Communication Engineering
        graduate and a motivated fresher eager to begin my professional career
        in the IT and technology field. I have a basic foundation in Java, HTML,
        CSS, SQL, and Linux, and I am continuously working to improve my
        technical and problem-solving skills. I have a strong interest in
        learning new technologies and adapting quickly to industry requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a fresher, I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my
        skills, gain practical experience, and grow professionally. I am a quick
        learner, dedicated, and adaptable, with a strong willingness to
        contribute positively to a team and organization while continuously
        upgrading my knowledge.

      <h3>Smart Building Sites Using AI & RSSI</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        My project, <strong>“Smart Building Sites Using AI and RSSI to Ensure Proper
        Worker Attire and Safety Compliance”</strong> focuses on improving safety at
        construction sites by combining artificial intelligence with IoT
        technologies. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with
        sensors such as heart rate, temperature, and fall detection sensors to
        continuously monitor workers’ health and physical conditions in real
        time. These sensors help detect abnormal situations like sudden falls,
        unusual body temperature, or irregular heart rate, ensuring early
        identification of potential risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the project uses the YOLOv8 deep learning model with
        computer vision to automatically detect whether workers are wearing
        mandatory personal protective equipment (PPE) such as helmets and safety
        vests. To enhance worker tracking and rescue operations, RSSI (Received
        Signal Strength Indicator) technology is used to estimate worker
        location within the site by analyzing BLE signal strength. A real-time
        monitoring dashboard displays worker health status, PPE compliance, and
        location details for site supervisors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system is designed to generate instant alerts when safety violations
        or health issues are detected. A GSM module is integrated to send SMS
        notifications to the site engineer during emergencies, enabling quick
        response and reducing accident impact. Overall, this project aims to
        create a smart, reliable, and efficient safety monitoring solution that
        minimizes workplace accidents and improves overall worker safety in
        construction environments.
